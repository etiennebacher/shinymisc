[CAREFUL - WORK IN PROGRESS]

`tinyslider` is an R package that allows to create a carousel via the JavaScript library [tiny-slider](https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider). It doesn't have any Javascript dependencies so there shouldn't be conflicts with other htmlwidgets.

You can install this package with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etiennebacher/tinyslider")
```

See [here](https://tinyslider.etiennebacher.com/#/) for the documentation.
